# Sprinkler Range


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1179?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod gathers information about objects in your farm and displays range information using an overlay by drawing over the window after other layers have finished drawing.
