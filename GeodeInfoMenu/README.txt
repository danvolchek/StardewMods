Explanation of each option:

ActivationKey: The key to press to open the menu. (default "K")
NumberOfNextGeodeDropsToShow: The number of items to show in the geode tabs. (default 20)
ShowStarsNextToMineralsAndArtifactsNotDonatedToTheMuseum: If set to true, there will be a star next to each artifact or mineral you haven't donated to the museum yet. (default true)

Note: I recommend you leave these as they are, unless how the menu works annoys you.

RememberMenuStateAfterClose: If this is true, after you close the menu and then re-open it, it will save your entered text in the search box, which tab you had open, and how far you scrolled in each page. (default true)
IfRememberingMenuStateAlsoRememberScrollBarPositions: If the above option is true, then if this is set to false the menu will NOT remember how far you scrolled down each page. (default true)
RightClickOnOnlySearchBoxToClearText: If set to true, then only right clicking on the search box will clear the text. If it is false, you can right click anywhere to clear the text. (default false)
PressingEscapeWhileTypingInSearchBoxInstantlyClosesMenu: If set to false, escape first unselects the search box if it was selected. If set to true the box instantly closes even if the search box was selected. (default true)
