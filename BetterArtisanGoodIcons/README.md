# Better Artisan Good Icons


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod overwrites the corresponding draw functions for artisan goods using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), and then draws the right texture for them based on what was used to make them. 

Note that this repo does not contain the Harmony dll, and the ones found in the mentioned link are not compiled targeting .NET 4.5. You'll need to compile for .NET 4.5 yourself, or just copy the dll packaged in the release.
