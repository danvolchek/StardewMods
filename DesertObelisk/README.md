# Desert Obelisk


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2021) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

It adds a new Blueprint to the wizard's item list, and then associates a texture with that Blueprint. Instances of the vanilla building are replaced with my own instance that warps to the right place when the building is created, and it is saved to its own json file to avoid save file issues.
