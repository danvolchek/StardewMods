# Unofficial Mod Update Menu, now updated for 1.6!

How to use:
Install Smapi:
Copy this file into your 'Mods' folder: [ModUpdateMenu.zip](https://github.com/Dphill10827/StardewMods/files/14670049/ModUpdateMenu.zip)


## How it works

Adds a menu to the title screen accessible by a new button which displays info about mod status. Mod updates are taken from the update checks SMAPI does. This is an updated version for Stardew 1.6 that allows users to click links again.
